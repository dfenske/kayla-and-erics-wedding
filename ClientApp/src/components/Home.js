            <p>
              For those of you that don't yet know our unique story, it began on
              Sept. 30, 2014 when Kayla walked into the downtown Seattle AT&T
              store to buy a new cell phone with her dad. Eric came over to
              assist this new customer and soon discovered he was helping a
              fellow soccer fan and lover of all things Italian. Over the next 4
              years, a strong friendship and love grew between us. We provide
              each other a tremendous amount of support and entertainment and
              frequently go on adventures together all over the world. We could
              not be more excited for this next step in our lives together and
              look forward to celebrating it with all of you.
